# Approaching (Almost) Any Machine Learning Problem

## Supervised vs unsupervised learning

* Supervised data: always has one or multiple targets associated with it
* Unsupervised data: does not have any target available

## Supervised learning
• Classification: predicting a category, e.g. dog or cat.  
• Regression: predicting a value, e.g. house prices.
